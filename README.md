A daily calendar spanning normal business hours (9-5). Each hour has a slot available for saving events or descriptions.

Motivation:

I made this work day scheduler to work with moment.js and help better understand how to save and retrieve data from local storage.

How to use:

When the page loads, the current day and time will display at the top of the page.

When the time block of any hour is clicked, the user is prompted to type something.

When the submit button is clicked, the information typed is saved in local storage. It will also be displayed in the time block for that hour.

Credits:

I received significant help from my tutor Simon Rennock, as well as personal friends Dave Mruczek and Rob Mruczek.

I was taught and guided by instructor Ron Bailey, along with the TA's Ankita Patel, Asha Tadimari, Hiram Abraham, Irwin Marcano, Marie Trull, and Radomir Fugiel.
